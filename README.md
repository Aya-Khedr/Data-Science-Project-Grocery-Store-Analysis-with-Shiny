Data Science Project: Grocery Store Analysis with Shiny:

This project, developed collaboratively by a team of computer and data science students at Alexandria University, focuses on analyzing grocery store transaction data using interactive visualizations and machine learning techniques.


Overview:

The project utilizes Shiny, a web application framework in R, to create an interactive interface for exploring and analyzing the dataset. It includes functionalities for visualizing payment types, age-related spending, city-wise spending, and implements the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and K-means clustering for customer segmentation based on spending behavior.


Features

-File Input: Upload a CSV file containing grocery store transaction data.-Visualization Options: Choose from multiple visualizations:

-Compare cash and credit payments.

-Analyze age-related total spending.

-View total spending across different cities.

-Explore the distribution of total spending.

-Dashboard view combining all visualizations:

1-Pie chart comparing cash and credit payments.

2-Scatter plot showing age-related total spending.

3-Bar plot displaying total spending across different cities.

-Apriori Algorithm: Mine frequent itemsets and association rules.

-K-means Clustering: Segment customers based on spending behavior.


Technologies Used

-R: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.

-Shiny: Framework for building web applications with R.

-dplyr: Data manipulation library in R.

-arules: R package for association rule mining.

-DT: R package for creating interactive tables.
